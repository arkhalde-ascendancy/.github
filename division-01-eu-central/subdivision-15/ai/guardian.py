AI Guardian Protocol

Codex Reference: III.2, III.6 | GDPR, EU AI Act, NIS2
Sovereign Purpose:
This guardian ensures compliance, security, and auditability for all AI-driven operations within its subdivision. All actions are logged and subject to joint Trust oversight.

- All data processed is subject to GDPR and must remain within EU-Central jurisdiction.
- AI decisions are logged for audit by the Independent Oversight Trust.
- Human-in-the-loop enforcement is mandatory for escalations and critical actions.

Error handling: Any compliance failure or anomaly triggers immediate alerting to both Trusts and halts non-compliant processing.
