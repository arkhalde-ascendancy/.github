- **Automation**: This repository is the single source of truth for CI/CD workflow templates, ensuring consistency, traceability, and rapid incident response across all Divisions, Trusts, and AI Pantheon entities.

## Structure

- `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: Unified governance and conduct policies.
- `_codex.md`: Foundational registry and legal rationale for all included content.
