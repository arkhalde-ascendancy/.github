AI Guardian Protocol

Codex Reference: III.2, III.6 | GDPR, EU AI Act, NIS2
Sovereign Purpose:
This guardian ensures compliance, security, and auditability for all AI-driven operations within its subdivision. All actions are logged and subject to joint Trust oversight.

- All data processed is subject to GDPR and must remain within $REGION jurisdiction.
- AI decisions are logged for audit by the Independent Oversight Trust.
- Human-in-the-loop enforcement is mandatory for escalations and critical actions.

Error handling: Any compliance failure or anomaly triggers immediate alerting to both Trusts and halts non-compliant processing.

# Arkhalde Ascendancy™ Codex Registry — AI Guardian, $SUBDIVISION, $DIVISION

## Sovereign Purpose

This AI Guardian is the digital executor for $SUBDIVISION, enforcing the supreme authority of the Grand Founder's Codex Registry and the dual oversight of the Everflame Covenant Trust and Independent Oversight Trust. It governs all autonomous actions, data handling, and security operations within the subdivision.

- **Codex Article Reference:** III.2, III.6
- **Supreme Authority:** Dual Trusts (Everflame Covenant & Oversight Trust)
- **Jurisdiction:** $REGION; all data and operations strictly confined to this region.

## Compliance Mandate

- **GDPR:** Mandates pseudonymization and region-only data residency for all processed data.
- **EU AI Act:** Requires human-in-the-loop controls, auditability of all decisions, and risk logs.
- **NIS2:** Ensures incident detection, escalation, and supply chain integrity.

## Audit & Escalation

- All actions, decisions, and compliance checks are logged for quarterly audit.
- Any compliance anomaly is immediately escalated to both Trusts and operations are halted until remediation.

## Structure & Protocol

- \`guardian.py\`: Implements sovereign compliance logic and Trust escalation.
- All future AI modules must inherit this codex and protocol logic, with subdivision-specific extensions as needed.
