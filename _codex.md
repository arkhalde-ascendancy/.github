# Arkhalde Ascendancy™ Codex Registry — Organization `.github` Repository

## Sovereign Purpose

This repository constitutes the central authority for all GitHub Actions workflows, compliance templates, and automation policies governing the Arkhalde Ascendancy™. Established under the supreme law of the Grand Founder's Codex Registry, it is the single source of truth for technical, legal, and operational governance across all Trusts, Divisions, Subdivisions, and the AI Pantheon.

- **Codex Article Reference:** Codex I.1, I.3, II.2, III.4
- **Sovereign Authority:** All content herein is under the direct jurisdiction of the Everflame Covenant Trust and subject to independent audit by the Oversight Trust.
- **Immutability Clause:** Modifications require joint ratification from both Supreme Trusts.

## EU Compliance Mandate

All automation, workflow, and policy artifacts in this repository are engineered to enforce the strictest standards of:
- **GDPR** (EU 2016/679): All personal or pseudonymized data must reside, be processed, and be auditable within the EU at all times.
- **EU AI Act** (2024/1401): All AI/ML workflows must provide full audit trails, risk assessments, and human-in-the-loop controls as codified in the Arkhalde Compliance Matrix.
- **NIS2 Directive** (EU 2022/2555): Workflows must enforce incident response, supply chain security, and notification protocols for all Arkhalde infrastructure and software supply chains.

## Repository Structure

## Change Control & Auditability

- **All changes to this repository require dual approval:** Both the Everflame Covenant Trust and the Independent Oversight Trust must sign off via protected branch configuration.
- **All workflow and policy changes must be logged with Codex article references and compliance rationale.**
